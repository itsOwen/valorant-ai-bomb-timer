Hello everyone this is a old release I created when I was Learning Python.

(I am sorry I can't make exe and please don't ask for it)

## Steps to install:
1. Download & Install python 3
2. After that open cmd and type : pip3 install python-imageseach-drov0
3. Then open cmd or PowerShell and do this: (directory where you .py file is stored)/python name.py

## How to use:
1. Set game to windows mode.
2. Run the cheat.

You as Planter: When you are planting the bomb as soon as the bomb is active, you will see a countdown on the top left corner you will know when the bomb is going to blast, So this will help you in really tough situations.

You as Defuser: When you the enemy rushed and planted the bomb, then you will know how much time you have to defuse the bomb or to fight your enemies. This will help you are a great deal.

When Seconds counter on Top Left is Green means all is good you can hold. When the seconds counter is yellow means you need to hurry and be near the bomb. When it turns red run from there because it's about to explode. you cant defuse it

Note: The images I have provided in the zip file is taken on default game and default desktop settings, so if you have some different ingame color settings it will have a hard time detecting the images of the bomb, So all you can do is a screenshot by pressing windows key + PrintScreen the crop the images precisely like I did and replace them with the ones I added.
